# AP CS 2018 Runnable Problems

I reverse engineered the 2018 AP CS A FRQ problems and created files that can be run and played with. I included the original problem and working solutions for each. The solutions are my own working ones, and I also included explanations for each one. 

The code is set up so that the exact code written for these problems may be used as answers on the paper test for the 2018 exam.
